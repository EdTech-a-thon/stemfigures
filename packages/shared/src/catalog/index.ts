// Every generator on every STEM Figures site. Each generator lives on one
// site (`site`), which is its only address; `alsoOn` lists the sites whose
// directories show it too, after their own generators. Searching any site's
// directory finds generators from every site.
//
// The one exception is a generator copied onto two sites so each has it at
// its own address (Length Reading, on Math and Chemistry): it has an entry
// on each, with the same id. See docs/adr/0001-a-generator-on-two-sites.md.
//
// An editor (`kind: 'editor'`) is listed like a generator, but the teacher
// draws its figure by hand, so there are no settings in its address.
//
// A generator turned off (`off: true`) keeps its entry and its code, but is
// left out of CATALOG, so no directory, search, sitemap or docs page lists
// it and its page is a 404. Delete the flag to turn it back on.
//
// Adding a generator means adding its entry to its site's file here, its
// preview to that app's src/lib/generators/index.ts, and a preview snapshot
// (see previews.ts).
