# Physics Figures

Generators for clean, printable physics figures that teachers paste into
tests, worksheets and slides. Live at **https://physicsfigures.com**, a teacher.dev
project. See `CONTEXT.md` for the vocabulary (figure, generator, directory…)
and `docs/adr/` for decisions.

## Pages

- `/` **Directory**: every generator as a card with a live preview, plus a
  card to request one we don't make yet. There are no generators yet, so the
  request card (the plus button) is the only one.
- `/about`, `/privacy`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`

Every page has the top bar: the site name, the current generator, and a
"Built by teacher.dev" link, which the footer repeats. The directory's search box filters its cards as
you type, and its last card is **Request a generator**. Generators fill the
window with no footer. The help button in the corner opens the same kind of
email dialog. Behind every page are faint physics doodles: an atom, a wave,
a pendulum, a spring, a lens, a free body diagram and an orbit.

A generator's settings live in the page address, so a link opens the same
figure, and the server renders that figure on first load (see ADR 0001).
Saved presets stay in the browser's localStorage.

## Code layout

```
src/routes/            SvelteKit pages
src/lib/site/          top bar, directory dialogs, Help, footer, SEO
src/lib/shared/        pieces every generator uses: figure card and toolbar,
                       undo history, presets, dialogs, fields
src/lib/generators/    index.ts lists every generator; one folder each
```

To add a generator: make a folder under `src/lib/generators/` with its
builder and preview, add one entry to `generators/index.ts`, and add its route
under `src/routes/`. The directory, search and sitemap pick it up from the list.

## Development

```bash
npm install
../scripts/agent-dev.mjs physicsfigures   # from the workspace, never npm run dev directly
npm run check   # svelte-check (TypeScript, strict)
npm run build
```
