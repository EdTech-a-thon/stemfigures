# Math Figures

Generators for clean, printable math figures that teachers paste into tests,
worksheets and slides. Live at **https://mathfigures.com**, a teacher.dev
project. See `CONTEXT.md` for the vocabulary (figure, generator, directory…)
and `docs/adr/` for decisions.

## Pages

- `/` **Directory**: every generator as a card with a live preview, plus a
  card to request one we don't make yet.
- `/coordinate-grid` **Coordinate Grid Generator**: equations to graph (straight
  lines and points, one per row), range and numbering,
  chart and axis titles (text or a blank line for students), axis labels, and
  a Figma-style end cap for each end of each axis. Presets, undo/redo, copy
  image, PNG/SVG download and copy link.
- `/triangle` **Triangle Generator**: a triangle drawn to scale from any three
  of its sides and angles (typed with fractions or √), solved for the rest.
  Each side and angle is labeled with its measure, typed math like x, or
  nothing, with congruence marks; heights, right-angle squares, a unit,
  rounding, base side, flip and turn. Labels can be dragged on the figure.
- `/rectangle`, `/parallelogram`, `/trapezoid`, `/kite` **Rectangle,
  Parallelogram, Trapezoid and Kite Generators**: one page each, drawing its
  own kinds (rectangles and squares; parallelograms and rhombi; trapezoids,
  isosceles and right trapezoids; kites) to scale from the measures the kind
  asks for. The same labels and markings as the triangle, plus parallel arrows,
  heights to AB and diagonals with a named crossing point.
- `/regular-polygon` **Regular Polygon Generator**: a regular polygon of 3 to
  20 sides, sized by its side, radius or apothem, with the apothem, a radius or
  all the radii drawn from its center, and marks on every side and angle.
- `/mapping-diagram` **Mapping Diagram Generator**: inputs and outputs typed or
  pasted as lists (or as ordered pairs), and arrows chosen per input, so it can
  show a function or a relation that isn't one; the panel says which, and why.
  Each side is titled (Input and Output, or text, a blank line or nothing) and
  drawn in an oval, a box or nothing.
- `/<generator>/examples/<slug>` **Example figures** (see below), and
  `/reuse`, how teachers may reuse them.
- `/about`, `/privacy`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`

Every page has the top bar: the site name, the current generator, and a
"Built by teacher.dev" link, which the footer repeats. The directory's search box filters its cards as
you type, and its last card is **Request a generator**. Generators fill the
window with no footer. The help button in the corner opens the same kind of
email dialog.

Each generator's settings column opens with a card saying what it makes and
a Start from an example button, which loads an example figure's settings
(`src/lib/site/GeneratorLead.svelte`); the top bar's About button opens a
drawer with what its figures are for, what can be set, its examples and
frequently asked questions, from `src/lib/site/generatorCopy.ts`, which also
goes into the page's structured data.

A generator's settings live in the page address, so a link opens the same
figure, and the server renders that figure on first load (see ADR 0001).
Saved presets stay in the browser's localStorage.

## Code layout

```
src/routes/            SvelteKit pages
src/lib/site/          top bar, directory dialogs, Help, footer, SEO, each
                       generator's About drawer and its words (generatorCopy.ts)
src/lib/examples/      example figures, their answer keys and gallery
src/lib/shared/        pieces Math's generators use: math fields and their
                       SVG layout, sections, help tips, end-cap and row-style pickers
$shared/               ../../packages/shared: pieces shared with the other sites,
                       including the generator page, figure card and toolbar,
                       undo history, presets and the generator catalog
src/lib/shapes/        the shape layer the triangle, quadrilaterals and regular
                       polygon share:
                       laying out and drawing a shape's parts, labels and
                       markings, the label popup and extra-line options;
                       quadrilateral/ holds the kinds and the page all four
                       quadrilateral generators use, each generator's folder
                       only naming its family (its kinds and opening figure)
src/lib/generators/    index.ts lists every generator; one folder each
```

A shape generator works out where its corners go and what each part says,
and hands that to `shapes/layout.ts`; every mark and label is placed there.
Every part has an id (a corner "B", a side "AB", an extra line "hB" or
"dAC"), which a future click-to-label canvas can use to pick parts out.

To add a generator: make a folder under `src/lib/generators/` with its
builder and preview, add its entry to `$shared/catalog/math.ts` and its preview
to `generators/index.ts`, add its route under `src/routes/`, and retake the
preview pictures (see `packages/shared/README.md`). The directory, search and
sitemap pick it up from the list.

## Example figures

Each generator has a handful of example figures, so search engines have real
pictures to index. Each one has:

- its settings, title, alt text and caption in `src/lib/examples/examples.ts`
  (the first of each generator is its best);
- a static page at `/<generator>/examples/<slug>`, built by
  `src/routes/[generator=examplegenerator]/examples/[slug]/`, with the picture,
  its answer key (worked out by the generator's own code in
  `src/lib/examples/details.server.ts`), an "Edit this figure" link that opens
  the generator with those settings, and a PNG download;
- its picture at `static/examples/<generator>/<slug>.png`, listed in
  `sitemap.xml` as an image of both its page and its generator's page.

A generator's first example is also its social card, `static/og/<generator>.png`
(1200×630). `src/lib/examples/ExampleGallery.svelte` shows a generator's
examples as a grid of thumbnails. Who may reuse the pictures, and how, is in
`src/lib/examples/license.ts` and the `/reuse` page.

The build fails if an example's settings aren't ones its generator keeps as
written (a misspelled choice, measures that make no triangle), so a picture
can't show a different figure than its page describes.

### Redoing the pictures

After adding or changing an example, or changing how a generator draws, take
the pictures again. With the site running:

```sh
./scripts/agent-dev.mjs stemfigures/apps/math                          # from the workspace root; prints its address
node scripts/snapshot-examples.mjs --app=math http://localhost:10003/  # from stemfigures/, with that address
node scripts/snapshot-examples.mjs --app=math http://localhost:10003/ triangle   # just the examples whose page matches "triangle"
```

It opens each example's generator, exports the figure as the Download buttons
do (about 1600 pixels on its longest side, on white), saves it and the social
cards under `static/`, and records each picture's size in
`src/lib/examples/sizes.json`. It needs the Chromium Playwright installs
(`npx playwright install chromium`). Look at the pictures before committing
them, and delete the PNG of an example you removed or renamed.

## Development

```bash
npm install   # once, from the stemfigures repo root (npm workspaces)
../../../scripts/agent-dev.mjs stemfigures/apps/math   # from the workspace, never npm run dev directly
npm run check   # svelte-check: strict TypeScript across .ts and .svelte files
npm test        # unit tests and figure snapshots
npm run build
```
