Lane 2 holds the uncut PCR product from the TAS2R38 bitter taste gene; lanes 3 to 5 hold it after cutting with HaeIII, which cuts the taster allele but not the nontaster allele, for a TT taster, a Tt taster and a tt nontaster. The smallest fragment is faint and runs past the 100 bp band, below what a 2% gel separates well.',
